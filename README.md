# RailRover
Wifi-controlled robot running on narrow gauge light railway tracks in preparation for [Chaos Communication Camp 2019](https://events.ccc.de/category/camp/camp-2019/) at [Ziegeleipark Mildenberg](https://www.ziegeleipark.de/)

The repo is currently a loose collection of bits and pieces (scripts, code, 3D designs, etc.) used to build a [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) version of a remote-controlled rover. 

We start with basic functionality: "forward, backward, stop" and plan to add more sophisticated stuff later.
